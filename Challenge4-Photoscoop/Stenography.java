/**
 * This class does nothing worth talking about.
 * Go away. You can edit this file if you want but you don't
 * There's nothing gradeable here. Please stop reading.
 * It's probably just some spare code. I'm sure it does
 * nothing useful. It might even not be good code to read.
 * I'm sure there are more pressing physics/chemistry/math
 * assignments that you could be doing.
 * It won't help. You won't learn anything. I'm surprised
 * that you still have this file open. Just close it now
 * and be done with it. You could be browsing Facebook
 * like the rest of the world. Creativity... Making things...
 * Solving problems is over-rated. There's plenty of day 
 * jobs at fast food places. You could be a real-people
 * person there instead of just staring at the screen.
 * Don't forget you've got graded homework, friends etc
 * to think about. I'd stop thinking about this file.
 * Ok don't. But just because I'm not trying reverse
 * psychology doesn't mean it wont not negatively fail.
 * This message is longer than a tweet so I'm sure you've
 * stopped reading by now.
 * 
 * TL;DR good.
