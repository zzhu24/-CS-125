Welcome to the second graded CS125 MP - 'Hollywood'

As the lead programmer for the Writers Guild of America,West (WGA) you have three programming tasks today:
* Create a survey to find out how people are watching movies (cinema,dvd,computer)
* Fix an existing program to extract the lines for each actor from a movie script
* Write a new program to search for and print an actor's lines.

*************************************************************************
** Read this document from beginning to end, then read MovieSurvey.txt **
*************************************************************************

Your code challenges are described in MovieSurvey.txt, MyScriptPrinter.txt and FindScriptLine.txt

* First a warning notice: 
It is a violation of academic rules of integrity to claim the work of others as your own.
It's also unfair, unethical and makes the cheater more likely to fail in the exam and in future courses.
Copying / Copy-pasting code from other sources is very tempting and misses the point of these assignments.
Penalties start with an automatic drop of one grade letter for the course, a public note on file,
failing the entire course and include suspension/dismissal from the University.
(See the CS Web site and the Student Code for more information:

)

* Deadline:
Due Monday 8pm 2/16/14. Do it now! Having said that, late regrades will be 
offered albeit with a small penalty. Having said that, MP2 and MP3 are your stepping
stones to the doing well on future quizzes.

* Compile error in TextIO?
If you see a compile error inside TextIO then you need to change the compiler level:
Window Menu>Preferences>Java>Java Compiler
-> Change '1.8' to '5.0' or '1.5'  (or 6.0 or 1.6)
-> You may also need to rebuild the project: Select Project menu item then Clean...

* Can't edit/run your code?
Did you checkout "Challenge2-Hollywood" (correct), or your netid as an Eclipse project?
Are you looking at the contents of a remote java file from the subversion server?
If so, you can't edit it. The hint is the title of the window includes a version number e.g. "Example.java 1234"
To fix close the tab then re-open the file from the package view
 

* Input and Output
A modified version of TextIO.java is included with this challenge: Thus...

You can use System.out.println / print or the TextIO.putln equivalents.
You can use Java's inbuilt Scanner class or the simpler TextIO.getln / getlnInt().

Remember that TextIO.getInt is different from TextIO.getlnInt()
the second version consumes the newline character from the input stream,
the first will not - so the _next_ get...() will read a blank line!
If in doubt, always consume the newline character e.g. getlnInt and getln

* How to get zero/one point(s) on the MP
 - Not starting early, forgetting to commit your changes back to subversion
 - Your code has an infinite loop
 - Your code calls System.exit
 - Your code does not compile

* Submission, Grading and subversion notes

In the package window, right click on your java file and select TEAM> COMMIT... and complete the dialog that pops up.

You need to COMMIT your changes to the java files (MovieSurvey.java,FindScriptLine.java,MyScriptPrinter.java) back to the subversion repository.
You may but do not need to make changes to any other files - for grading purposes we will only use the above three files.
You can commit your files multiple times - in fact we expect you to. (You can even go back to previous versions that you committed).

After the deadline we will grade the last version you committed BEFORE the deadline.

You can check that your solution is correct by running the automated unit tests (there is a testing file provided for each one).

You can run all three units in one go: In the package window right click on 'default package' and select RUN AS... JUNIT TEST
You can run the autograder yourself: right click on GradeChallenge2 and select RUN AS ... JAVA APPLICATION. This has the effect of
running all three unit tests and printing a score based on the number of tests passed.

* Eclipse hints
The most useful views (windows) are : Package, Console, Problems, JUnit and SVN Repository views.

* Getting help
Please use the class newsgroup. However please don't post solutions / correct code.
If you would like to sign-up for a cs125 mentor to help you please send an email to your TA  with the subject line INeedHelp
Use the TA office hours
NB It's a good idea to start early and get stuck early, rather than panic two hours before the deadline!
Good luck and have fun!

* What you will learn (Learning Objectives)

The purpose of these programming assignments is for you to learn following -
JAVA CORE KNOW-HOW:
# Format text output using TextIO put and putln methods.
# Read input from the keyboard using getln,getlnInt.
# Create and use String, int, boolean, double variables.
# Perform simple calculations using arithmetic operators.
# Use String instance methods contains,trim,toLowercase.
# Use integer arithmetic (division).
# Use floating point arithmetic. 

PROGRAMMING CORE SKILLS:
# Translate program descriptions into a complete Java program.
# Find and fix runtime errors in existing code.
# Use unit tests and manual testing as part of the development process.
# Use Eclipse Development environment to create, run, test and commit programs.
# Add comments and authorship
# Reading source code for Pong Game
