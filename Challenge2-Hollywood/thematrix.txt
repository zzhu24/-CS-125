	INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
	his age.  The Potentials are all little children.

	The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
	kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
	shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
	others meditating or practicing their gift.

	Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
	blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
	blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

	Neo crosses to him, sits.

	The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
	imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
	it bend.

					SPOON BOY
			Your spoon does not bend because
			it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
			bends because there is no spoon,
			just my mind.

	Neo watches as it curls into a knot.

					SPOON BOY
			Link yourself to the spoon.
			Become the spoon and bend
			yourself.

	Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.  Right.

	He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
	Priestess touches his shoulder.

					PRIESTESS
			The Oracle will see you now.

	Spoon Boy smiles.


	INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
	zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
	a three-legged throne.

	The throne is empty.

					NEO
			Hello?

	A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
	the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
	cooking.

	Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
	finds an open door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Just come on in.

	He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
	moonstone headdress and velvet robes.  A second door
	leads into --


	INT.  ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY

	It looks like a suburban tract house.

	There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
	filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
	doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

	Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

	A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
	through the cracked door.

					NEO
			Hello?

					ORACLE (WOMAN)
			I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
			with you.

					NEO
			You're the Oracle?

					ORACLE
			Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
			you non-believers.  It's really a
			relief.  All that pomp and
			circumstances just plain tucker me
			out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
			don't they?

					NEO
			Yeah.

					ORACLE
			I'd ask you to sit down, but
			you're not going to anyway.  And
			don't worry about the vase.

					NEO
			What vase?

	He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
	the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

					ORACLE
			The vase.

					NEO
			Sorry.

	She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
	She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
	comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
	someone's grandma.

					ORACLE
			I said don't worry about it.  I'll
			get one of my kids to fix it.

					NEO
			How did you know...?

	She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.

					ORACLE
			What's really going to bake your
			noodle later on is, would you
			still have broken it if I hadn't
			said anything.

	Smiling, she lights a cigarette.

					ORACLE
			You're cuter than I thought.  I
			see why she likes you.

					NEO
			Who?

					ORACLE
			Not too bright, though.

	She winks.

					ORACLE
			You know why Morpheus brought you
			to see me?

					NEO
			I think so.

					ORACLE
			So? What do you think?  You think
			you're the one?

					NEO
			I don't know.

	She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
	has, except that the words are in Latin.

					ORACLE
			You know what that means?  It's
			Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

	She puts her cigarette down.

					ORACLE
			Well, let's have a look at you.

	She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
	glands in his neck.

					ORACLE
			Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

	She nods then looks at his palms.

					ORACLE
			Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
			it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
			is, you're not the one.  Still got
			a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

					NEO
			What's the good news?

					ORACLE
			Same as the bad news, you're not
			the one.

					NEO
			Is that it, then?

					ORACLE
			No.  Here.

	She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.

					ORACLE
			You better take a cookie.  Got a
			big day ahead of you.

	He eyes her, then takes a cookie.

					ORACLE
			Make a believer out of you yet.


	INT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
	out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
	Neo's shoulder.

					MORPHEUS
			You don't have to tell me
			anything, Neo, because I already
			know what she said.

					NEO
			You do?

					MORPHEUS
			I brought you so that you could
			hear it for yourself.  I knew it
			would help.

	Neo finishes his cookie.

					MORPHEUS
			No one will ever ask you because
			it is a gift from her.  It is for
			you and you alone.
