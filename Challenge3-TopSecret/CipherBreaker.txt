Your program will do the following: Print "Text?", Read in one line of text,
print it and analyze the frequency of each character and print a summary -
which describes the number of times each character appeared in the line:

Count Upper and Lower case letters as the same. Print out the frequency of
each letter, provided the frequency >0. Also count the number of spaces,
digits and number of punctuation marks (Do not count the newline character at
the end of the line). The only six punctuation marks you need to consider are
"-'.!, Ignore all other characters (e.g. tabs,accents, chinese
characeters...)

For example, if the input is:A-C E'? 099A "

Then the output should be (each count should be on a separate line):

Text?
A-C E'? 099A "
A:2
C:1
E:1
DIGITS:3
SPACES:3
PUNCTUATION:3

Example output for input:2B @# OR NOT(2B)!

Text?
2B @# OR NOT(2B)!
B:2
N:1
O:2
R:1
T:1
DIGITS:2
SPACES:3
PUNCTUATION:1


However see the unit test for definitive output examples.
